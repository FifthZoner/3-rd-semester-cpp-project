# A C++ SFML based space fighting/whatever game!
This is a project I made for my c++ course, it's supposed to have a Starfield-like ship editor (in 2D not 3D, so much simpler), and gameplay will consist of fighting enemies, mpossibly foraging materials.

How to build:
- setup a cmake project in vs code via extenson
- use the supplied CMakeLists or copy it over the generated one*

* you might need to install SFML dependencies first, not tested on windows
